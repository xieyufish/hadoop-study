Apache Hive is a data warehouse infrastructure built on top of Hadoop for providing data summarization, query, and analysis.
Apache Pig is a platform for analysing large data sets. Pig's language is a simple query algebra that lets you express data 
transformations such as merging data sets, filtering them, and applying functions to records or groups of records. 
Users can create their own functions to do special-purpose processing.Hadoop is the Elephant King!
A yellow and elegant thing.
He never forgets
Useful data, or lets
An extraneous element cling!
A wonderful king is Hadoop.
The elephant plays well with Sqoop.
But what helps him to thrive
Are Impala, and Hive,
And HDFS in the group.
Hadoop is an elegant fellow.
An elephant gentle and mellow.
He never gets mad,
Or does anything bad,
Because, at his core, he is yellow.
